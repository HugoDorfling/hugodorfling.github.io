        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p><strong>My name is Hugo Dorfling</strong> and I was born on the 15th of March, 1995 in South Africa.</p>

          <img width="600" height="600" style="display: block;  border-radius: 50%; filter: drop-shadow(3px 3px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.6))" src="./assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="a current picture of me" />
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>Since the day I had the privilege to lay my hands on a computer I have been 
          <strong>passionate about <i>solving problems</i> and <i>expressing myself</i> through technology.</strong></p>

              <div class="about-img-div">

              <p>
              <strong>I was 13 when I started freelancing and designing</strong> professional logo's, websites, banner ads, 
              business cards and more. <br />
              At 14, I was so proud to buy myself a Wacom Bamboo tablet as 
              an investment into greater quality and freedom in my design work.</p>

          
          <p>I developed my own portfolio website that same year (hugodorfling.com) turning my 
            PSD design into HTML & CSS. 
            <br /><br />
            I also designed t-shirts for my high school's athletes. </p>

              </div>

          <p>
            After diving into web development I was certain that 
            programming next on my list to master.</strong> <br/> My artistic drive however made me pickup a 
            guitar as well...
            <br /><br />
            At high school, in the subject Information Technology, I was exposed to <strong>the Delphi programming language (an object oriented language) and SQL 
            where the fundamentals of programming was laid strong in my intellectual foundations.</strong> </p>

            <br /> <br />
            <p>
            I also fell in love with making music and joined the church band, where I became the 
            worship leader of the youth church.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>We were such a dynamic creative team at our youth church and I dabbled in video 
              editing, as well as building props from my designs used in church and many more.
              
              <div class="about-img-div">

              <p></p>
              Just before turning 18, I had the opportunity to go to Chiang Mai in Thailand, to a school for creatives in christian ministry, to play guitar and sing for 
              two weeks.

              <div class="about-img-div">
                <img width="450" height="400" class="about-img" src="./assets/images/IMG_1839.JPG" alt="me singing in thailand" />

              </div>
             
              <p>This led up to an increasing motivation to pursue a life 
              in christian ministry as I was deeply moved to find purpose and meaning in life.</p>
              <div class="about-img-div">

              </div>

              <p><strong>I finished high school (in 2013) with all seven of my subjects 80% and above, higher 
              grade <i>Mathematics (80%)</i> with the electives: <i>Physical Sciences (86%)</i>, <i>Information 
              Technology (92%)</i> and <i>Accounting (95%)</i>.</strong></p>

                <i>Instead of continuing to pursue my passion in technology after school,<strong><br/>I focused 
                on first establishing a strong sense of self and to develop my worldview.</strong> </i> <br/>

                <p>I got the opportunity to start as a youth coach at a high school (2014), working with 
                youth to mediate between psychologists and social workers, counselling and teaching 
                life skills.</p>

                <p>
                I did a lot of work redesigning the Christian Activity framework at 
                the school, painted walls, created videos and constant social media art. We even 
                held a fantastic launch event with a full band, lights and I preached my heart out. 
                It was a fantastic experience.</p>

                <br /> <br />
                <p>The following year I got a job as a Youth Pastor and started the youth church where
                I redesigned the logo, printed banners and merchandise. I created marketing material,
                from videos to flyers and held an event inviting parents to share the vision and 
                strategic plan for the cirriculum and activities of youth church. </p>

                <p>
                This was such a great opportunity for me but it was super challenging as I had not received a 
                salary from the church but instead had to raise funds to sustain myself with a sponsorship
                model. We had youth camps and went on mission trips to Botswana and much more... </p>

                I knew that <strong><i>I absolutely love coming up with solutions to problems in order to make

                wanting to solve and <strong>I knew that technology is the key to unlocking my full potential.</strong> 
                
                <br /><br />
                <i>I tried creating a cross platform mobile application using Xamarin and C# and <strong>rediscovered
                  my love for creating solutions and innovations through the art of programming.</strong></i>
                <br /><br />
                <strong>I decided to switch careers and pursue studies in BCom Informatics which was the perfect
                 harmony between business and information technology.</strong>               </p>

                <p>I was invited to the Investec Bursary Selection Programme but unfortunately didn't receive the bursary.
                  I reached out to a friend of mine's father and he sponsored me to study so I can try to apply for bursaries using
                  my first year university marks.

                 <p>My knack for people and systems as
                  well as a passion for software made me breeze through the <i>first semester at University
                   of Pretoria with the following marks</i>: Financial Accounting 111 (89%), Information 
                   systems 113 (87%), Business Management 114 (86%), Statistics 110 (85%), Informatics 
                   154 (84%), Economics 110 & 120 (72%).
                </p>
                   
                   <br /><br /> 
                 <p> <strong> C# was the programming language of choice for this
                  degree with SQL database focus, but the main specialization was in systems analysis and design.</strong>
                </p>
              <p>
                I also <i>adopted a much more open-minded view of the world and started exploring many different
                 viewpoints and religions in order to learn and grow.</i><br /><br /> I reached a point where I was 
                 overwhelmed with the complexity of trying to grasp at understanding the universe, 
                 the world we live in and my deep inner battles. <br />
                 <br/>
                 I was also frustrated in the cookie-cutter 
                 approach of universities and <strong>wanted to start building real world experience as <u>I felt I 
                 need to explore what exactly I want to specialise in through working.</u></strong> 
                 
                 <br /><br />
                 I also didn't want to sit with huge amounts of student debt and waste my financial sponsor's money. <i>I left university at the start 
                 of the second semester exam.</i>  (Something I would look back at with some regret but I have definitely proven to myself
                 that real world and practical application of theory solidifies understanding and gives context to studies.)
                <br /> <br />
                I started off in the networking world as a <strong>Wireless Field Technician at Bronberg Connect (WISP) (Oct 2018)</strong> .
                <br /><br />
                I then moved into an <strong>IT Support Engineer role at ProtechIT (Dec 2018)</strong>  and got my <strong> CompTIA A+ and N+ certifications.</strong>
                <br /><br />
                I then was fast tracked into a <strong>Product Success Manager role at a startup called Howler (Jul 2019).</strong>
                <div class="about-img-div">
                  <img width="450" height="400" class="about-img-square" src="./assets/images/hugodorfling-at-howler.jpg" alt="university group project meeting" />
                </div>  
                <br />
                <br />
                I reported to the Product Owner, working closely with the development team and the rest of the business.
                <i><br/><br/>I was exposed to the full SDLC, an agile workflow and gained tremendous experience of what it takes to 
                ship production ready solutions and adapt to real world challanges.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>I was the tech lead on the Cashless Product, which entailed an Android Application for RFID cashless 
                transactions and an administration portal built on Ruby on Rails.</strong> <br /><br /> This exposure to  <strong>working closely with 
                the developers, identifying bugs, eliciting requirements from stakeholders, ideating with the team 
                and writing out user stories <i>sparked a fire in my heart.</i> </strong> <br />This was what I want to be doing, this was the 
                team I want to be on. <br /><br /> I realised that each and every role in the product team interested me, product 
                management, design, development and QA. 
                <br />
                I soon formulated my plan, made my decision and in February of 2020, <strong>I left Howler
                to pursue my dream to become a world-class software developer!</strong> 
                <br /><br />
                I decided to try and get into the tuition-free coding university called WeThinkCode (based on 42.fr) as 
                some of the developers I was working with got their foot in the software industry through their programme.
                <br/><br/>
                I was bound to go through selection bootcamp in March but with Covid-19 and lockdowns, this was delayed to
                June 2020. I realised that in order to survive till then, <strong> i'll have to quickly sharpen up my web development
                 skills and start sustaining myself again through freelancing.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong> I started off with freeCodeCamp.org, revising HTML and CSS. I also started learning JavaScript and because
                my fundamentals was laid strong I found it extremely intuitive and easy. </strong> 
                <br />
                I just got used to the latest developments
                in programming and <u>sharpening up my Algorithms and Data Structure knowledge.</u>
                <br/><br/>
                I joined Leetcode, CodeWars and Hackerrank
                to start practicing to solve problems regularly. <i><br/> I received my 'Responsive Web Design' and 'JavaScript Algorithms and 
                Data Structures' certificates from freeCodeCamp.org and I was hooked.</i> 
                <br />
                <strong>I jumped into the React framework for front end development using Redux, learnt NodeJS using Express and MongoDB. </strong> 
                <br /><br />
                I was really impressed at the advancements in web technologies and realised the <u>potential of single page web apps and the
                potential of serverless.</u> <strong> <br/>I also dived straight into Linux, Unix shell scripting and C Programming to further grow my knowledge 
                of how things work on the lower level and understand key operating system fundamentals.</strong> 
                <br /> <br /> 
                Preparing for the selection bootcamp which was fully focused on the C programming language, 
                I arrived more than prepared and <i>aced the exams and the challenges thrown at me.</i>

              <br />
              <p>
                <strong> WeThinkCode offered my a full-tuition bursary along with stipend per month, but unfortunately 
                I was not able to sustain myself to study full-time even with the assistance. </strong>
                <br /><br/>
                I started looking at the job market and saw a tremendous demand for C# and ASP.NET. 
                I wanted to check out what the fuss was all about and soon realised the extreme increase 
                of productivity, managability of code, potential for test driven development and the 
                advancements from the Microsoft team. 
                <strong><br/>
                I was quickly up and running with ASP.NET Core MVC 
                and quickly explored the Angular framework with TypeScript as I saw this was the most 
                sought after combination. 
              </strong>
                I have got to say it was love at first sight and it felt extremely 
                natural to me as the workflow made sense and seemed like my best bet to invest and specialise 
                in.
                <br /><br />
                I'm also an avid gamer and the potential for developing games with Unity and C# is another 
                reason why I am super excited to continue to master my skills and grow in this direction.
